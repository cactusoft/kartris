             Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets
             for use by UI Extensions and app backends.
            
             The primary resource in Secret Store is a <c>secret</c>. Other apps can't view secrets
             created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission
             control.
            
             All Dashboard users and the app backend share <c>account</c> scoped secrets. Use the
             <c>account</c> scope for secrets that don't change per-user, like a third-party API key.
            
             A <c>user</c> scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard
             user. Use the <c>user</c> scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where
             different users might have different permissions.

             activity or validation performed is <c>new</c>. If Stripe can determine that the bank
             account exists, its status will be <c>validated</c>. Note that there often isn’t enough
             information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always
             run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will
             be <c>verified</c>. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit
             failure, the status will be <c>verification_failed</c>. If a transfer sent to this bank
             account fails, we'll set the status to <c>errored</c> and will not continue to send
             transfers until the bank details are updated.
            
             For external accounts, possible values are <c>new</c> and <c>errored</c>. Validations
             aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means
             the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to <c>errored</c>
             and transfers are stopped until account details are updated.

             The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing
             management.
            
             A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide
             to your customers through the portal.
            
             A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular
             customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and
             billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the
             customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to
             manage their subscriptions and billing details.

             <summary>
             Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your
             account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new <c>Event</c> object. For
             example, when a charge succeeds, we create a <c>charge.succeeded</c> event; and when an
             invoice payment attempt fails, we create an <c>invoice.payment_failed</c> event. Note
             that many API requests may cause multiple events to be created. For example, if you
             create a new subscription for a customer, you will receive both a
             <c>customer.subscription.created</c> event and a <c>charge.succeeded</c> event.
            
             Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that resource

             As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event">individual event</a> or a <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events">list of events</a> from the API. We also
             have a separate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhooks</a> system for
             sending the <c>Event</c> objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are
             managed in your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks">account
             settings</a>, and our <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks">Using Webhooks</a>
             guide will help you get set up.
            
             When using <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect">Connect</a>, you can also receive
             notifications of events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will
             be an additional <c>account</c> attribute in the received <c>Event</c> object.
            
             <strong>NOTE:</strong> Right now, access to events through the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event">Retrieve Event API</a> is guaranteed
             only for 30 days.

             A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user.
             The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the <c>type</c> and
             <c>options</c> parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check
             performed in the appropriate sub-resource: <c>document</c>, <c>id_number</c>,
             <c>selfie</c>.
            
             Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as
             reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/files">FileUpload</a> API. To configure and create
             VerificationReports, use the <a

             identities of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such as
             what <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/identity/verification-checks">verification
             check</a> to perform. Only create one VerificationSession for each verification in your
             system.
            
             A VerificationSession transitions through <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/identity/how-sessions-work">multiple statuses</a>
             throughout its lifetime as it progresses through the verification flow. The
             VerificationSession contains the user's verified data after verification checks are
             complete.

             Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off,
             or generated periodically from a subscription.
            
             They contain <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems">invoice items</a>, and
             proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if
             necessary).
            
             If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe
             automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the
             invoice, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance">when
             automatic</a>, does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until
             one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out
             after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks
             configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.
            
             If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your <a
             href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic">email settings</a>, Stripe
             will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a
             link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
            
             Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for
             the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the
             invoice is less than Stripe's <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts">minimum
             allowed charge per currency</a>, the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add
             the amount due to the customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
            
             More details on the customer's credit balance are <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance">here</a>.

             You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices">Prices API</a>. It replaces the Plans API and
             is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.
            
             Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of
             products. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#products">Products</a> help you track
             inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or
             levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be
             represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your
             provisioning scheme.
            
             For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has plans for $10/month,
             $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.

             Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring
             and one-time purchases of products. <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#products">Products</a> help you track inventory or
             provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or
             levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be
             represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change
             your provisioning scheme.
            
             For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month,
             $100/year, and €9 once.

             The Report Run object represents an instance of a report type generated with specific

        <member name="T:Stripe.SetupIntent">
             <summary>
             A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's
             payment credentials for future payments. For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set
             up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment. Later, you
             can use <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents">PaymentIntents</a> to
             drive the payment flow.
            
             Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment
             credentials. Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer
             be valid. The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses">statuses</a> as it
             guides you through the setup process.
            
             Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future
             payments. For example, cardholders in <a
             href="https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication">certain regions</a> may
             need to be run through <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication">Strong Customer
             Authentication</a> at the time of payment method collection in order to streamline later
             <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents">off-session payments</a>. If
             the SetupIntent is used with a <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer">Customer</a>, upon
             success, it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer. We
             recommend using SetupIntents or <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage">setup_future_usage</a>
             on PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or
             unoptimized payment methods.
            
             By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of
             required friction, even as regulations change over time.

             You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices">Prices API</a>. It replaces the Plans API and
             is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.
            
             Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of
             products. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#products">Products</a> help you track
             inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or
             levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be
             represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your
             provisioning scheme.
            
             For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has plans for $10/month,
             $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.

             For <c>collection_method=charge_automatically</c> a subscription moves into
             <c>incomplete</c> if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this state can
             only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the
             subscription moves into an <c>active</c> state. If the first invoice is not paid within
             23 hours, the subscription transitions to <c>incomplete_expired</c>. This is a terminal
             state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.
            
             A subscription that is currently in a trial period is <c>trialing</c> and moves to

             created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment

             Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account
             details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a
             secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use.
             You should use our <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments">recommended payments
             integrations</a> to perform this process client-side. This ensures that no sensitive
             card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant
             way.
            
             If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API
             with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if your integration
             uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance that may be required, and
             you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your
             customer's information is not sent directly to Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is
             handled or stored.
            
             Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
             information for later use, you can create <a

            This converter can be used to deserialize any Stripe object. It is mainly useful for
            polymorphic attributes, when the property's type is an interface instead of a concrete type.
            In this case, the converter will use the value of the `object` key in the JSON payload to
            decide which concrete type to instantiate. If no concrete type is found (or if one is found,
            but it's not compatible with the expected interface), then the converter returns `null`.

             additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA
             regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA
             Migration Guide</a> for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

             intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are
             needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA
             regulation</a>, or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates">pending
             updates</a>. When you use <c>pending_if_incomplete</c> you can only pass the parameters

             Use <c>error_if_incomplete</c> if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a

             authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter
             does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default

             additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA
             regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA

             intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are
             needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA
             regulation</a>, or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

             Use <c>error_if_incomplete</c> if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a

             authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter
             does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default
             behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the <a

             Use <c>allow_incomplete</c> to create subscriptions with <c>status=incomplete</c> if the
             first invoice cannot be paid. Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to
             manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's
             invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment.
             See the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA
             Migration Guide</a> for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.
            
             Use <c>default_incomplete</c> to create Subscriptions with <c>status=incomplete</c> when
             the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition
             to <c>status=active</c> when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first
             invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are
             needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA
             regulation</a>, or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment
             intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to
             <c>status=incomplete_expired</c>, which is a terminal state.
            
             Use <c>error_if_incomplete</c> if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a
             subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires
             3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this
             parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the
             default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14">changelog</a> to learn more.

             additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA
             regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA
             Migration Guide</a> for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

             intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are
             needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, <a
             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication">SCA
             regulation</a>, or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

             href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates">pending
             updates</a>. When you use <c>pending_if_incomplete</c> you can only pass the parameters

             Use <c>error_if_incomplete</c> if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a

             authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter
             does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default

             Abstract base class for string enum parameters.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             This class is used to define request parameters that can only take certain string values.
             We use it instead of defining a regular <c>enum</c> with
             <see cref="T:System.Runtime.Serialization.EnumMemberAttribute"/> annotations for
             serialization because <c>enum</c> is really an integer under the hood. This can be
             problematic in some cases, like when a parameter can be an integer OR a string enum (e.g.
             <see cref="P:Stripe.PlanTierOptions.UpTo"/>).
             </remarks>
             <example>
             This sample shows how to define a new string enum type.
             <code>
             public class FooBar : StringEnum
             {
                 public static readonly FooBar Foo = new FooBar("foo");
                 public static readonly FooBar Bar = new FooBar("bar");
            
                 private FooBar(string value) : base(value) {}
