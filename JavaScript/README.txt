From v2.6 onwards, we store the Foundation-related Javascript files
in a folder named for that particular Kartris version (e.g. 26000).
This way, the new v2.6 skin can link to these new files, but the 
older versions of the files remain in the same place so that older
v2.5 skins will still work with v2.6 without problems.
